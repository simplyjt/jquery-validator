2/14/2011 Changes by Peter Ehrlich

 - Added rspec testing code for many (but not all) vaalidators
 - Added support for one validator with multiple fields (attributes)
 - The :only parameter can now take a symbol as well as an array
 - It now correctly figures out the form name for forms named with the :as parameter.  (Devise is good example)
 - Added support for the :if and :unless validator options
 - Added support for the :message validator option

TODO:
 - readme update (should I do this?)

Several things are incomplete and still need work:
 - Finish test code and add cucumber testing
 - Add support for :on option.  This would require somewhat involved coding, as where the rails validators determine on create or or update, this would need to detect new and edit instead.
 - There appear to be issues with the inclusion/exclusion validator
